abstract="Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are based on highly simplified brain dynamics and have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems. Throughout their development, ANNs have been evolving towards more powerful and more biologically realistic models. In the last decade, the third generation Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed which comprise of spiking neurons. Information transfer in these neurons models the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and has the potential to result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, SNNs have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems defined by time series because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents an overview of the development of spiking neurons and SNNs within the context of feedforward networks, and provides insight into their potential for becoming the next generation neural networks.",

abstract = "The computational power of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other neural network models based on McCulloch Pitts neurons (i.e., threshold gates), respectively, sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology."
